# Website
Personal website

This is a small personal website. I used bootstrap for the visual design, jQuery to get my data (JSON) files, and ractive.js to neatly seperate the template and the data. I am looking into other libaries (namely Angular.js and Ember.js, but Ractive.js) was great because it was quick to learn and easy to use.
